                <p class="h10">
                    Cities, since ancient times, have been the manifestation of the highest achievements of civilizations. Cities acquire their own form and culture, as they develop historically over centuries. It is the Form and Culture, which is unique to each city, gives it its identity, attitude, heritage, historical bonds, its special strengths, a strong sense of place, which in turn has established the competitiveness and innovativeness that drive great cities. Despite the overwhelming trends towards a homogenization of physical/visual characteristics of urban projects in cities all over the world, it is the distinction and difference between one place and the other that we cherish and it gives it the economic competitiveness as well.
                    <br> <br>
                    The effects of “liberal economics” and Media have penetrated even the small towns, leading to the rapid development of haphazard urban areas, which oscillate between poorly constructed building formations without any visually or physically distinctive attributes to the creation of environmental/ecological nightmares. Urban Planning practices rarely go beyond outdated technical norms. And yet many cities have hung on to their distinctive identities formed out of their histories, cultures, locations, geographies etc. Modernization and Development does lead to immense expansion of urban areas, today. Cities offer great opportunities for new possibilities for development in every sphere. Yet, as we have seen recently that they are becoming increasingly vulnerable to many natural and human-induced factors. Therefore, it is crucially important for our societies that we get the planning and design of cities RIGHT. This proposed Kathmandu Institute is an initiative in this direction.
                    <br> <br>
                    The Kathmandu Valley has been a unique geographical space in South Asia, nestled between the Gangetic Plains and the Himalayas, which forms the border with the Tibetan Plateau. Its location and fertile soil irrigated by an elaborate river system has resulted in a flourishing habitation over the millennia, resulting in the development of a sophisticated urban civilization. Although different social, cultural and artistic traditions informed this development, what emerged up to the 18th century was a synthesis, perhaps unparalleled in the world - a sophisticated structure of cities and towns in a definite hierarchy with characteristic arts, architecture and urban design.

                <img src="../images/about/image_3.png" class="col-12">
                <br> <br> <br>
                <p class="h10">
                    The Kathmandu Institute is envisioned as an international center for research, learning, debate on contemporary cities leading to Design and planning of future urban landscapes in the region. It shall work in collaboration with other national and international centers of renown. It is based on the basic premise that knowledge produced locally is most useful and effective. The production of such knowledge is envisaged as an intensive collaboration between local experts, students, professionals and international partners. In this regard, Kathmandu valley, with its two millennia old urban civilization and as one of the most cosmopolitan cities in South Asia, offers an ideal laboratory to initiate and develop the activities of the Institute.
                    <br> <br>
                    While cities are becoming places of immense possibilities and gateways to the global systems, they are also becoming increasingly difficult places to live for everybody rich or poor, although in varying degrees. The Institute in its programs shall explore the immense transformation taking place in the making of cities, as new major infrastructure projects, socio-economic transformation and the intensification of communication technology have their impact on urban environmental conditions. The work of the Institute shall be informed by intensive interactions with experts drawn from many other fields, as city building is a collective enterprise of the society.
                    <br> <br>
                    Most importantly, the Institute is envisaged as a Place of engagement on urban issues, challenges and ideas, where politicians, bureaucrats, historians, social scientists, artists, economists, businessmen, architects, urban planners/designers, Engineers, journalists can all enthusiastically engage in. Such engagement also offers a much broader platform for the urban professionals to innovate fresh and out of the box ideas and solutions in their tasks of actually designing and building the city.
